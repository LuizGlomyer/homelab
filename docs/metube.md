# MeTube

MeTube provides a user-friendly web interface for `yt-dlp`, making it easy to download videos or audio from popular platforms without using the command line. Supports queueing, formats, and metadata.

As this uses yt-dlp, to download age restricted videos you will have to pass cookies as parameters. Check the docs.
